# Ground truth data
{: .no_toc}
A selection of ground truth cells are included. This list will be expanded with a greater selection and cell count. The plan is to ultimately do classification from ground truth cell metrics so if you have opto-tagged data that you are interested in sharing/including, please reach out to us. Please see the [ground truth tutorial]({{"/tutorials/ground-truth-tutorial/"|absolute_url}}) to learn more about using the included ground truth data.

### Classifying your cells in the CellExplorer
You can also implement your own ground truth cells into the pipeline or do the classification in the CellExplorer. Once classified you can share your metrics list with collaborators or provide them for publications. 

Please see the [opto-tagging tutorial]({{"/tutorials/optotagging-tutorial/"|absolute_url}}) for how to do the ground truth classification on your own data.
